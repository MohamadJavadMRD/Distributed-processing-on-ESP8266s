# Distributed-processing-on-ESP8266s
##### This is an academic project related to advanced computer architecture courses and communication networks, which was carried out in the fall of 2022 at the University of Tehran.

### Distributed processing on a network of low-power processors
###### Due to the fact that the processors in embedded systems have low processing power, it is not possible to perform heavy processing on these types of processors in a reasonable time.

### But in the other hand...

###### In general, we have a large number of these low-power processors in embedded systems, and we know that in many places, strength is in numbers! 
###### Therefore, we are creating a platform to connect these low-power processors to the WIFI platform so that they work as a unified processor so that we can take advantage of their total power when necessary.
